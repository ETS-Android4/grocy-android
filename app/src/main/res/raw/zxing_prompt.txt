Did you know that there are two different barcode scanners in this app?

You are currently using ZXing ("Zebra crossing"), but there is an option to switch to a better scanner in the settings: ML Kit ("Machine Learning Kit").
This one is faster, makes much less recognition mistakes and can recognize barcodes with any orientation.

You can unlock the ML Kit scanner with an additional tiny app, more infos are on the settings page.
