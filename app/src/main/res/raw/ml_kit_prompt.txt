Do you enjoy barcode scanning with ML Kit and think the developers of Grocy Android deserve a small donation for their work?

We understand that it is easier to download the unlock app for free from GitHub. However, we'd still love to see you purchase it in the Play Store to support our work!

If you want to buy the app, you need to uninstall the GitHub version before doing so. Thanks a lot!
